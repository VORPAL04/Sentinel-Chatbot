# Sentinel-Chatbot
An intelligent speech-based chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users using speech recognition 


This type of chatbot is able to understand and respond to spoken requests and questions, allowing users to interact with it using their voice. An intelligent speech-based chatbot can be integrated into a variety of platforms, such as smart speakers, mobile apps, or websites, and can perform a wide range of tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, making recommendations, or completing transactions. This type of chatbot is often used for customer service, information dissemination, and other tasks that require a high level of interaction and personalized communication with users.

INTRODUCRION 

Chatbots are computer programs that maintain a conversation with a user in natural language, understand the user’s intent and send responses based on the organization’s business rules and data.
These chatbots use Artificial Intelligence to process language, enabling them to understand human speech. 
They can decipher verbal or written questions and provide responses with appropriate information or direction
Chatbots also interact verbally with consumers, such as Siri on the Apple iPhone or Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service.

ABSTRACT

A chatbot is AI computer software that can act as a conversation through textual or auditory methods. The core of chatbots analyses a customer’s data using the artificial intelligence which integrates the response with them. 
Different tasks can be replaced with AI-powered bots as they are much more powerful—and are capable of performing multiple tasks at once. Machine Learning techniques are basically used in the process of understanding the input that we get from the user and replying to the user. 
Natural language processing allows a bot to have a conversation as naturally as possible. The ideal interaction between user and chatbot is a balanced mix of Innovative technology and human Intervention...

BUIKDING BLOCKS 

The chatbot consists of these key components: 
• A front-end interface, which connects to a variety of channels, such as websites, email, SMS, or messaging applications such as Facebook Messenger or Slack, through which users interact with the chatbot. 
Understanding intent is responsible for recognizing the user’s intent. This element uses natural language processing and machine learning to parse user messages, collect relevant parameters from words and sentences, and map those to actions to take. 
Another component manages the dialogue by maintaining a representation of the conversational logic and keeping track of context

Why are chatbots steadily gaining attention?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89768124/210609472-e2b597fd-f758-4805-8092-45a5eb65beaa.png)

Advancements in technologies and computing power have enabled chatbots to gain traction from major technology giants as early adopters. With advances in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence, machine learning algorithms can now understand queries just like the humans. 
Human Resource companies informally refer to Chatbots as a friend who helps you with tasks such as booking a flight ticket, reminding you to punch in for your attendance, sending a note to your newly joined team member or even training you for the next job interview.
Some chatbots can help with employee performance reviews and engagement while another can simplify the recruitment process through Artificial Intelligence

Do Chatbots have inherent advantages over humans!

Chatbots have a number of potential benefits over traditional GUIs. First, they can simplify applications for users. For example, rather than navigating through an interface or website to find information, users can just say or type what they want.
Second, the conversational UIs that chatbots offer may require little to no training, given that they understand and can interpret natural language and translate it into actions.
Third, users can leverage chatbots to operate several business applications at once
